# Generate table from raw ABET II behavioral data
## Description
This code takes raw data generated by the ABET II behavioral software and creates an organized table of relevant task events. 

.csv files generated by ABET are read in as a Pandas data frame, and then a series of functions pulls out relevant task events, including: 

- Trial block (1, 2, 3)
- Trial type (Forced vs. Free)
- Reward size (Large vs. Small)
- Shock (Shock vs. No shock)
- Trial start time (s)
- Reward choice time (s)
- Reward collection time (s)

These events are then concatenated according to the task trial number, using the Pandas groupby and apply methods. 

This table will then be integrated with calcium channel fiber photometry readings to allow for correlation of behavioral and neuronal activity.
